Echora connects to a [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) server and studies every track in it: how it sounds, what its lyrics say and how it relates to everything else you own. It turns that analysis into ways of listening that a plain file browser can't offer: word-timed karaoke, a map of your collection, playlists described in plain language, and search by humming.

Navidrome keeps hosting and streaming your files. Echora never modifies them, and it doesn't come with a catalog or a recommendation service. Everything it suggests comes from your own library.

## Features

### A player built around lyrics

- **Karaoke timing.** When a song has synced lyrics, Echora times every syllable with its own forced-alignment model, trained on singing in several languages, and highlights the words as they are sung.
- **Lyrics for songs that have none.** For vocal tracks without lyrics, an optional transcription model listens to the isolated vocals and writes them out.
- **Translations.** Connect any OpenAI-compatible model and Echora translates lyrics line by line, keeping each line paired with its timing.
- **Things to watch.** Pick from several audio-reactive visualizers, a waveform of the whole track and an optional melody line. On a capable GPU, Echora can also render a short looping animation from each album cover ([motion artwork](docs/motion-artwork.md)).
- Playback carries on while you browse. The queue, the mini player and the full-screen view stay in sync across pages.

### Find something without knowing its name

<img src="docs/screenshots/library.png" alt="The library with filters for artists, albums, vocals, lyrics availability and lyrics language, next to a track list with Hum to search and Identify song buttons." width="900">

- **Filters that understand the audio.** Narrow the library by artist and album, and also by whether a track has vocals, whether lyrics exist (and whether AI wrote them), and which language they are in.
- **Hum to search.** Hum or sing a few seconds of a melody, and Echora compares its pitch contour with the melodies it extracted from your tracks.
- **Identify song.** Let your microphone hear a song that's playing nearby, and Echora finds that recording in your library. This feature is opt-in and off by default.

### See your collection as a galaxy

<img src="docs/screenshots/galaxy.png" alt="The music galaxy: clusters of tracks drawn as coloured stars, a selected track's details and a Sonic journey panel listing a path between songs." width="900">

The galaxy draws every track as a star, close to the tracks it resembles. Switch between three kinds of resemblance:

| View | Based on |
| --- | --- |
| **Semantic** | Musical meaning: style, mood, vocals and instrumentation |
| **Acoustic** | The recorded sound itself: timbre, rhythm and production |
| **Lyrics** | What the songs are about |

Tracks gather into communities, which you can inspect along with the concepts that describe them. Pick two songs to get a **sonic journey**: a playable path that moves gradually from one to the other. The picture is only a projection for browsing. Rankings and journeys use the full underlying vectors, not distances on the screen.

### Describe the playlist you want

<img src="docs/screenshots/curations.png" alt="The curation editor with sound tags, a lyrical theme, a sound-shape radar for pace, energy, brightness, motion, vocals and dynamics, and a preview of the resulting songs." width="900">

A **curation** is a saved recipe for a playlist. Write down sounds (`+piano`, `-synths`), lyrical themes ("make you feel sad and painful"), a language, example songs, a time period or a journey. Optionally shape the sound with sliders for pace, energy, brightness, motion, vocal presence and dynamics. Preview the result, then save it. Echora publishes the result as a playlist in Navidrome and can rebuild it on a schedule.

Curations replace their playlist's contents each time they refresh, so edit the recipe rather than the playlist. If you connect **Last.fm**, curations can balance songs you play often against ones you haven't heard in a while, and can follow when in the day you tend to listen.

### Start from what you already play

<img src="docs/screenshots/home.png" alt="The home page with recently added albums, a most-played chart for the month, saved curations and shortcuts to explore, curate or open the galaxy." width="900">

The home page brings together recent additions, your most-played tracks from Last.fm, your saved curations and shortcuts into the rest of the app.

### Works with the rest of your setup

- **Navidrome plugin.** The [Echora plugin](plugins/navidrome/README.md) brings sonic similarity, artist radio and Echora's timed and translated lyrics to Navidrome's own apps and clients, through per-account API keys.
- **Several users.** People sign in through your OpenID Connect provider and each connects their own library. A track that two people own is analyzed once and shared.
- **Administration.** Administrators approve or block accounts, choose which models run, and configure Last.fm, the external AI endpoint and the integrations from **Settings**.

## How processing works

<img src="docs/screenshots/sync.png" alt="The sync page: library counts, a completed analysis stage and a list of the analysis models with the role of each." width="900">

Everything starts with a **sync**: Echora reads your Navidrome catalog and analyzes any track that it hasn't seen or whose analysis is out of date.

1. **Identity.** Each file is identified by a hash of its bytes, so a renamed or moved file is recognized. Echora uses Chromaprint fingerprints to notice when different files hold the same recording, and links them without deleting either.
2. **Preparation.** The audio is decoded once per purpose. A vocal separator splits off the singing, which several later steps share.
3. **Analysis.** A set of models, listed below, each record one aspect of the track.
4. **Indexing.** Vectors are stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector. The galaxy, search, curations and the plugin all read from there.

Work runs in durable background batches. A failed track doesn't block the others, finished results are kept and reused, and a sync can be cancelled or retried. Every result records the exact model revision that produced it.

| Model | What Echora uses it for |
| --- | --- |
| [MuQ-MuLan](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/MuQ) | Musical meaning, and matching music to descriptions (semantic galaxy, sound tags) |
| [MERT](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/MERT-v1-95M) | Acoustic structure: timbre, rhythm, pitch and production (acoustic galaxy, journeys) |
| [BGE-M3](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-m3) | Meaning of lyrics, in many languages (lyrics galaxy, themes) |
| Semantic fusion | A weighted blend of the MuQ-MuLan and BGE-M3 spaces |
| [Essentia](https://essentia.upf.edu/) Discogs-EffNet | Vocal presence and vocal character |
| [Mel-Band RoFormer](https://github.com/KimberleyJensen/Mel-Band-Roformer-Vocal-Model) | Separating vocals from accompaniment |
| Essentia MELODIA | Melody contours for hum search and the melody line |
| [fastText LID-176](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/language-identification.html) · [IndicLID](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicLID) | Lyrics language, including romanized Indic text |
| [Echora MMS-300M aligner](https://huggingface.co/hcX02/echora-mms-300m-multilingual-lyrics-forced-aligner) | Syllable timing for karaoke |
| [Echora MOSS transcriber](https://huggingface.co/hcX02/echora-moss-0.9b-multilingual-lyrics-transcriber) | Writing lyrics for vocal tracks that have none (optional) |
| [NMFP](https://github.com/raraz15/neural-music-fp) recording encoder | Identify song (opt-in) |
| [LTX-2.5](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2.5) via ComfyUI | Motion artwork (optional, needs a 24 GB GPU) |

Model files are downloaded once, at pinned revisions, into a local cache. The running service then works offline from that cache, so an upstream update can never change your results without you choosing a new revision.

Analysis is an informed estimate, not ground truth. Separation can leave instruments in the vocals, a melody tracker can follow the wrong line, and lyrics can belong to a different version of a song. When a step fails or doesn't apply, Echora leaves that feature out for the track and still plays it normally.

For details, see [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [ranking correctness](docs/analysis-correctness.md), [audio profiles](docs/audio-profiles.md), [audio descriptors](docs/audio-descriptors.md), [audio preprocessing](docs/audio-preprocessing.md), [lyric transcription](docs/song-transcription.md), [recording search](docs/recording-search.md) and [background jobs](docs/jobs.md).

## Requirements

**To run Echora:**

| Need | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Docker | Docker Engine with the Compose plugin |
| NVIDIA GPU | With current drivers and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. The analysis image is built on CUDA 13.0. |
| Navidrome | A server that the analysis container can reach, and an account for its Subsonic API |
| OpenID Connect provider | Echora has no password login of its own. Any standard provider works (Authentik, Keycloak, Authelia, Google and others). It must return an email claim. |
| Disk space | Tens of gigabytes for container images and model files, plus the database and analysis data, which grow with your library. Motion artwork needs about 44 GB more. |

How much GPU you need depends on your library and which steps you enable. There isn't a measured minimum yet. The first sync of a large library is the heaviest part, especially vocal separation, melody extraction and karaoke alignment. Administrators can switch karaoke and hum processing off under **Settings → Models**. Motion artwork is the one feature with a firm requirement: a full 24 GB card.

**Optional services:**

- A **Last.fm** account, for listening history in the home page and in curations.
- An **OpenAI-compatible endpoint**, local or hosted, for lyric translation and motion-artwork prompts.
- A **Hugging Face token** with access to the gated LTX-2.5 repository, if you want motion artwork.

The Compose file also defines a CPU-only analysis service under the `cpu` profile. The web service talks to the GPU service by default, so running without a GPU means changing the Compose configuration yourself.

## Installation

These steps run Echora on one machine with the supplied Compose file.

**1. Get the code and create your settings file.**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hackslashX/echora.git
cd echora
cp configs/env.example .env
```

**2. Fill in the secrets.** In `.env`, pick a database password and use it in both `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `DATABASE_URL`. Percent-encode any character in it that has a meaning inside a URL. Then generate the two keys:

```sh
# Session signing secret → OIDC_SESSION_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32

# Encryption key for stored credentials → CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY
python3 -c 'import base64, secrets; print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(secrets.token_bytes(32)).decode())'
```

Store `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` somewhere safe. Saved Navidrome and Last.fm credentials can't be decrypted without it, and generating a new one doesn't convert the old ones. Keep `.env` out of version control.

**3. Register Echora with your sign-in provider.** Create a client in your OIDC provider with this redirect URL (adjust the host later if you serve Echora elsewhere):

```text
http://localhost:3000/analysis/auth/oidc/callback
```

Then complete these entries in `.env`:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` | The issuer URL your provider publishes |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` / `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | The client you just created |
| `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` | The redirect URL above |
| `OIDC_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT` | `http://localhost:3000/home` |
| `OIDC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` | The email address that becomes the first administrator |

Set `OIDC_REQUIRE_VERIFIED_EMAIL=true` if your provider verifies addresses and you want Echora to insist on it.

**4. Download the models.** This step needs internet access and is the slowest one.

```sh
docker compose build analysis
docker compose run --rm --no-deps -e HF_HUB_OFFLINE=0 analysis \
  python -m echora_analysis.download_models
```

Run it again whenever an update changes the pinned models. To add motion artwork's models, follow [its guide](docs/motion-artwork.md).

**5. Start everything.**

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

The database schema is created and upgraded automatically when the analysis service starts. Check that everything is healthy:

```sh
docker compose ps
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

**6. Sign in and connect your music.** Open <http://localhost:3000>, sign in as the administrator, and enter your Navidrome address and account. That address is contacted **from inside the analysis container**, so `localhost` there means the container, not your computer. For a Navidrome running on the same machine, use `http://host.docker.internal:4533`. Choose a first batch of songs and let it finish before syncing everything. A small batch is a quick way to confirm the setup works.

Optional settings and their defaults are listed in [runtime settings](docs/runtime-settings.md).

## Running it day to day

- **Adding music.** Add files to Navidrome as usual, then run a sync from Echora's **Sync** page. *New tracks only* analyzes what's missing. *Entire library* also refreshes metadata and removes songs you no longer have.
- **What to back up.** Back up the PostgreSQL volume (`postgres-data`) and your `.env`. Model files under `data/models/` can always be downloaded again but are large, so keeping them saves time. `docker compose down` keeps your data, but `docker compose down -v` **deletes the database**.
- **Serving it beyond your machine.** The Compose file is meant for local use. It also exposes PostgreSQL and the analysis API. Before opening Echora to a network, close those ports, put the web service behind HTTPS, update the OIDC URLs and set `COOKIE_SECURE=true`. Run a single analysis replica.
- **What still uses the network.** The running service never downloads models, but it still talks to your sign-in provider, Navidrome, lyrics sources and, if configured, Last.fm and your AI endpoint.

---

## Development

The web app is Next.js and React (in `apps/web`). The analysis service is Python 3.12 and FastAPI (in `services/analysis`). They share a PostgreSQL 17 database with pgvector. The Navidrome plugin is in Go (in `plugins/navidrome`).

You need Node.js 22 or later for the web app. To work on the web app against a running backend:

```sh
npm install
docker compose stop web   # frees port 3000
npm run dev
```

The development server proxies analysis requests to `http://localhost:8000`.

Formatting runs as a pre-commit hook, with Prettier for TypeScript and Ruff for Python. Set it up once per clone:

```sh
npm ci
uv tool install pre-commit==4.6.2
pre-commit install
```

If the hook reformats a file, the commit stops. Stage the formatting changes and commit again.

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Web tests, type check, lint, build | `npm run test:web` · `npm run typecheck` · `npm run lint` · `npm run build` |
| Python tests | `PYTHONPATH=services/analysis/src pytest services/analysis/tests` (with the analysis dependencies and pytest installed) |
| Rebuild one container | `npm run rebuild:web` · `npm run rebuild:analysis` |

Tests that need a database read `TEST_DATABASE_URL`. Point it at a throwaway, migrated database, never at your real one.

Useful background: [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) defines the domain terms, and the [architecture decision records](docs/adr/) explain the major design choices.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, from bug reports to new features.

- **Open an issue first** for anything larger than a small fix, so the approach can be agreed before you write the code.
- **Keep pull requests focused.** One change per pull request, with tests that cover it and a description of how you verified it.
- **Run the checks** in [Development](#development) before you push, and keep the formatting hook installed.
- **Don't commit music, lyrics, artwork or model weights.** Screenshots must not show anything you can't share.
- **Report security problems privately,** as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), and not in a public issue.

By submitting a contribution, you agree that it is licensed under the same AGPL-3.0 license as the project.
