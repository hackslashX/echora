"""Optional analysis features, switched on per location (see docs/modal-compute.md).

A sync runs either on this server or on Modal. Each optional feature has one
switch per location, so a feature may run only where its hardware is: karaoke
switched on for Modal alone is skipped by local syncs and done by Modal syncs.
Core analysis (audio and lyric embeddings, voice) has no switch.
