# Echora Navidrome plugin

The Echora plugin delegates sonic discovery, metadata recommendations and lyrics
lookup to Echora. It implements Navidrome's provider contracts directly; it does
not require AudioMuse or impersonate AudioMuse's HTTP API.

## Implementation plan and status

1. **Consolidate Settings → Integrations:** Navidrome, Last.fm and the Echora plugin
   settings live together. Implemented.
2. **Account-scoped access:** enabling the integration generates its first key;
   additional labelled keys have configurable expiry and independent revocation.
   Implemented with SHA-256 hashes, one-time secret display and owner checks.
3. **Discovery:** similar tracks, paths, similar artists and artist radio reuse
   existing MuQ, MERT and BGE-M3 representations. Implemented without a new
   embedding index or analysis job.
4. **Native lyrics:** a Lyrics provider serves existing transcriptions, karaoke
   timings and completed translations. Implemented with TTML and LRC export.
5. **Validate and package:** backend credential/isolation/ranking tests, Go adapter
   tests, actual Navidrome lyrics parser tests and the `.ndp` build are provided.
   Installation on a real Navidrome instance and large-library latency measurements
   remain rollout checks.

## Compatibility and identity

The SDK and parser tests are pinned to Navidrome commit
`0e1893530b844898cbf87825fdefd4b13e1ff3cc` (2026-09-29). Use a Navidrome build
containing this commit or equivalent SonicSimilarity, Lyrics and TTML translation
support. Older builds may lack capabilities or enhanced lyrics support; this has
not been validated against every released Navidrome version.

The plugin's configuration is instance-wide. All callers use its configured
Echora key, so they receive the key owner's library scope and ranking preferences.
There is no Navidrome-user identity forwarding. Backend lookups require that
owner's source membership and the selected Navidrome connection's library
namespace; IDs from another server cannot resolve accidentally.

Keys only authorize the plugin API. They cannot access Echora's Settings or
ordinary session routes. Disabling the integration immediately stops key access.
Changing its connection revokes old keys. Existing expiry dates do not change
when the default lifetime is edited; generate a replacement and revoke the old
key to rotate it. Removing the owning account/connection removes its credentials.

## Install

1. Deploy the Echora web and analysis changes and apply Alembic migration
   `0055_navidrome_integration` using the project's normal migration workflow.
2. Connect the intended Navidrome server in Echora Settings → Integrations,
   enable Echora Navidrome plugin access, and copy the generated key and Plugin
   API URL. That URL must be reachable from Navidrome, including its container.
3. Build `dist/echora.ndp` using the instructions below, copy it into Navidrome's
   plugins folder (normally `<DataFolder>/plugins`), rescan, and enable Echora.
4. Set plugin `apiUrl` to the copied URL, such as
   `https://echora.example/analysis/integrations/navidrome/v1`, and `apiKey` to the
   generated key. This is the browser-facing proxy URL, not just the site origin.
5. Put `echora` first in metadata agent order and lyric source priority. Preserve
   the other providers you already use, for example:

   ```toml
   Agents = "echora,lastfm,deezer"
   LyricsPriority = "echora,.ttml,.yaml,.yml,.elrc,.lrc,.srt,.txt,embedded"
   ```

   Environment equivalents are `ND_AGENTS` and `ND_LYRICSPRIORITY`. Restart
   Navidrome after changing its server configuration.

Navidrome discovers the plugin's exported SonicSimilarity capability and supplies
its own public sonic endpoints. Client applications continue talking to Navidrome;
no Echora URL or key belongs in the client. Metadata discovery uses similar songs
by track, similar songs by artist and similar artists. Missing lyrics return an
empty result so Navidrome can try its next source.

The manifest requests configuration and HTTP access, with `requiredHosts: ["*"]`
to support administrator-configured self-hosted addresses. The adapter calls only
the configured URL, never follows redirects and does not expose remote error
bodies or credentials. Use HTTPS when crossing an untrusted network.

## Ranking and lyrics preferences

Musical / lyrical balance defaults to 80% / 20%. Within musical evidence, the
second slider blends MuQ musical character (70%) with MERT acoustic detail (30%).
Similar-track scoring averages available pairwise cosine evidence with these
weights, renormalizes missing components, and clamps the provider score to [0,1].
This is an evidence weight, not a probability or a calibrated match percentage.

Paths interpolate in a normalized weighted embedding space and reuse Echora's
journey selection. If either endpoint lacks lyrics and musical fallback is
selected, the whole path uses audio evidence consistently. Artist discovery uses
Echora's artist facets and representative songs over that weighted space.
Alternate source IDs and recording duplicates are suppressed. Artist limits can
produce fewer results than requested; path endpoints are always retained.

Choose musical fallback or exclusion for missing lyric embeddings. Settings are
stored per Echora account and are not extra parameters in Navidrome's provider
contract. Requests are bounded at 500 songs or 100 similar artists. The first
implementation reads the scoped corpus per discovery request; large libraries
need latency/memory measurement before broader rollout. Existing embeddings are
sufficient, though a future cache or candidate index may improve performance.

Lyrics requests use saved data only and never launch transcription, alignment or
translation. TTML carries line/syllable timing plus translation tracks with their
language and line mapping. Only completed translations with a matching source
checksum and matching line IDs are served. If karaoke segmentation differs from
the translated source, karaoke is retained and those translations are omitted.
Incomplete predicted syllables fall back to the authoritative line text.

LRC mode provides line timing and separate language variants. Navidrome and
clients determine display support: ordinary text remains available through native
lyrics APIs, while syllable highlighting and explicit translation tracks require
compatible versions/clients. The legacy `getLyrics` endpoint selects main lyrics.

## API contracts

All routes are POST under `/analysis/integrations/navidrome/v1` through Echora's
web proxy (analysis service path: `/integrations/navidrome/v1`). They require
`Authorization: Bearer <key>` and JSON bodies. Unknown metadata fields supplied by
the SDK are tolerated; numeric limits are validated.

| Route | Request fields | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/similar-tracks` | `song: {id}`, `count` | `{matches: [{song: SongRef, similarity}]}` |
| `/sonic-path` | `startSong: {id}`, `endSong: {id}`, `count` | Same envelope, ordered endpoints included; similarity `-1` |
| `/similar-artists` | `id`, `limit` | `{artists: [{id, name}]}` |
| `/artist-radio` | `id`, `count` | `{songs: [SongRef]}` |
| `/lyrics` | `track: {id}` | `{lyrics: [{lang, text}]}` |

`SongRef` contains Navidrome's source `id`, `name`, `artist`, `album` and
`durationMs`. Similar-songs-by-track maps the sonic response to the metadata
`{songs: [...]}` envelope inside the adapter. The Settings management API is
`/analysis/settings/integrations/navidrome` with GET/PUT, POST `/keys` and DELETE
`/keys/{id}`; it requires the normal Echora user session.

## Build and validation

Go 1.25+ and TinyGo 0.42.0 are needed for the plugin; parser contract tests require
Go 1.27 because the pinned Navidrome source does. Python 3 is used for packaging.

```sh
make test
make package
cd contract-tests
go test ./...
```

The package contains exactly `manifest.json` and `plugin.wasm`. Generated packages
are ignored by Git. Backend tests in
`services/analysis/tests/test_navidrome_plugin.py` validate the exporter against
the checked-in parser fixtures and exercise the actual credential migration on
an isolated PostgreSQL schema when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is set. Without that
variable, database tests skip; use a disposable test database, never production.

For environments with limited temporary storage, set `TMPDIR`, `GOCACHE` and
`GOMODCACHE` to directories on a sufficiently large volume before building.

Before production rollout, verify on the target Navidrome build: plugin loads and
shows SonicSimilarity/Metadata/Lyrics capabilities; sonic endpoints return valid
local IDs; metadata radio works; lyrics fall back for missing tracks; translations
and timing render in the intended clients; revoked/expired keys stop working.
